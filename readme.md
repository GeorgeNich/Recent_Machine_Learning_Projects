Welcome to the "Recent_Machine_Learning_Projects" repository! This repository contains a collection of recent machine learning projects developed by George Nicholson for various purposes. Each project showcases different aspects of machine learning techniques, ranging from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model building and evaluation.

## Projects:

### 1. Cryptocurrency Price Prediction with Machine Learning

- **Description:** This project utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast the future price of the JUP cryptocurrency. By leveraging historical data on market cap, volume, and price from Orca and Uni, along with JUP-specific data on volume and market cap via Prophet, this algorithm aims to provide insights into potential price movements over the next two months.
